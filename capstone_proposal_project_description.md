# Capstone Proposal Project
## Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
## Topic: Specialization

*Author a proposal to apply machine learning algorithms and techniques to solve a problem of your choice.*

## Capstone Proposal Overview
In this capstone project proposal, prior to completing the following **Capstone Project**, you you will leverage what you’ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to author a proposal for solving a problem of your choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. A project proposal encompasses seven key points:

1. The project's **domain background** — the field of research where the project is derived;
2. A **problem statement** — a problem being investigated for which a solution will be defined;
3. The **datasets and inputs** — data or inputs being used for the problem;
4. A **solution statement** — a the solution proposed for the problem given;
5. A **benchmark model** — some simple or historical model or result to compare the defined solution to;
6. A set of **evaluation metrics** — functional representations for how the solution can be measured;
7. An outline of the ****project design — how the solution will be developed and results obtained.

## Capstone Proposal Highlights
The capstone project proposal is designed to introduce you to writing proposals for major projects. Typically, before you begin working on a solution to a problem, a proposal is written to your peers, advisor, manager, etc., to outline the details of the problem, your research, and your approach to a solution.

Things you will learn by completing this project proposal:

* How to research a real-world problem of interest.
* How to author a technical proposal document.
* How to organize a proposed workflow for designing a solution.

**Please note: Once your Capstone Proposal has been submitted and you have passed the evaluation, you have to submit your Capstone project using the same proposal that you submitted. We do not allow the Capstone Proposal and the Capstone project to differ in terms of dataset and approach.**

## Capstone Proposal Description
Think about a technical field or domain that you are passionate about, such as robotics, virtual reality, finance, natural language processing, or even artificial intelligence (the possibilities are endless!). Then, choose an existing problem within that domain that you are interested in which you could solve by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. Be sure that you have collected all of the resources needed (such as datasets, inputs, and research) to complete this project, and make the appropriate citations wherever necessary in your proposal.

**Please note you cannot use the MNIST or SVHN dataset for this project.**

In addition, you may find a technical domain (along with the problem and dataset) as *competitions* on platforms such as [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/), or [Devpost](http://devpost.com/). This can be helpful for discovering a particular problem you may be interested in solving as an alternative to the suggested problem areas above. In many cases, some of the requirements for the capstone proposal are already defined for you when choosing from these platforms.

To determine whether your project and the problem you want to solve fits Udacity's vision of a Machine Learning Capstone Project , please refer to the [capstone proposal rubric]() and the [capstone project rubric]() and make a note of each rubric criteria you will be evaluated on. A satisfactory project will have a proposal that clearly satisfies these requirements.
