    "# Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk\n",
    "\n",
    "This competition is sponsored by [Home Credit](http://www.homecredit.net), whose mission is to provide a positive and safe borrowing experience to groups of people that traditional, mainstream banks and financial institutions typically refuse to serve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Home Credit targets a demographic that typically has no recourse but to deal with shady characters such as loan sharks when borrowing money. Many of these unbanked individuals are hard-working, well-intentioned folks who, either due to circumstances beyond their control or past mistakes, have fallen through the financial system’s cracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Home Credit needs an algorithm that will take as inputs various financial and personal information originally taken from a loan applicant's profile, and then determine and output a probability of the applicant eventually repaying the loan. This probability will be in the range [0.0, 1.0], where 1.0 represents a 100% certainty that the applicant will repay the loan and 0.0 indicates that there is zero chance that the applicant will eventually repay. The algorithm will be tested on a set of 48,744 individuals who previously borrowed from Home Credit. A CSV file must be produced that contains one header row, and 48,744 prediction rows, where each prediction row contains both a user ID, the `SKI_ID_CURR` column, and the probability, the `TARGET` column, of that user repaying their loan. The file must be formatted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SK_ID_CURR,TARGET\n",
    "    100001,0.1\n",
    "    100005,0.9\n",
    "    100013,0.2\n",
    "    etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Home Credit knows which borrowers ultimately paid off their loans, and which ones eventually defaulted. A good algorithm will need to predict a high probability of repayment for the majority of borrowers who did successfully repay their loans. This algorithm will also need to predict a low probability of repayment for the majority of borrowers who eventually defaulted on their loans."
