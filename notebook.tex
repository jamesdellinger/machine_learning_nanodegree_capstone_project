    \section{Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk
Competition}\label{kaggle-home-credit-default-risk-competition}

https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk

This competition is sponsored by \href{http://www.homecredit.net}{Home
Credit}, whose mission is to provide a positive and safe borrowing
experience to groups of people that traditional, mainstream banks and
financial institutions typically refuse to serve.

Home Credit targets a demographic that typically has no recourse but to
deal with shady characters such as loan sharks when borrowing money.
Many of these unbanked individuals are hard-working, well-intentioned
folks who, either due to circumstances beyond their control or past
mistakes, have fallen through the financial system's cracks.

Home Credit needs an algorithm that will take as inputs various
financial and personal information originally taken from a loan
applicant's profile, and then determine and output a probability of the
applicant eventually repaying the loan. This probability will be in the
range {[}0.0, 1.0{]}, where 1.0 represents a 100\% certainty that the
applicant will repay the loan and 0.0 indicates that there is zero
chance that the applicant will eventually repay. The algorithm will be
tested on a set of 48,744 individuals who previously borrowed from Home
Credit. A CSV file must be produced that contains one header row, and
48,744 prediction rows, where each prediction row contains both a user
ID, the \texttt{SKI\_ID\_CURR} column, and the probability, the
\texttt{TARGET} column, of that user repaying their loan. The file must
be formatted as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
SK_ID_CURR,TARGET
100001,0.1
100005,0.9
100013,0.2
etc.
\end{verbatim}

Home Credit knows which borrowers ultimately paid off their loans, and
which ones eventually defaulted. A good algorithm will need to predict a
high probability of repayment for the majority of borrowers who did
successfully repay their loans. This algorithm will also need to predict
a low probability of repayment for the majority of borrowers who
eventually defaulted on their loans.

    \subsubsection{Data Description}\label{data-description}

From https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{application\_\{train\textbar{}test\}.csv}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  This is the main table, broken into two files for Train (with TARGET)
  and Test (without TARGET).
\item
  Static data for all applications. One row represents one loan in our
  data sample.
\item
  \textbf{bureau.csv}
\item
  All client's previous credits provided by other financial institutions
  that were reported to Credit Bureau (for clients who have a loan in
  our sample).
\item
  For every loan in our sample, there are as many rows as number of
  credits the client had in Credit Bureau before the application date.
\item
  \textbf{bureau\_balance.csv}
\item
  Monthly balances of previous credits in Credit Bureau.
\item
  This table has one row for each month of history of every previous
  credit reported to Credit Bureau -- i.e the table has (\#loans in
  sample * \# of relative previous credits * \# of months where we have
  some history observable for the previous credits) rows.
\item
  \textbf{previous\_application.csv}
\item
  All previous applications for Home Credit loans of clients who have
  loans in our sample.
\item
  There is one row for each previous application related to loans in our
  data sample.
\item
  \textbf{POS\_CASH\_balance.csv}
\item
  Monthly balance snapshots of previous POS (point of sales) and cash
  loans that the applicant had with Home Credit.
\item
  This table has one row for each month of history of every previous
  credit in Home Credit (consumer credit and cash loans) related to
  loans in our sample -- i.e. the table has (\#loans in sample * \# of
  relative previous credits * \# of months in which we have some history
  observable for the previous credits) rows.
\item
